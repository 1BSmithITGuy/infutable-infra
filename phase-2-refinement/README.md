## Purpose

Phase 2 transitions the lab from exploratory experimentation to a production-style Kubernetes platform. The focus is on operational discipline, recoverability, GitOps-driven deployments, and enterprise-aligned tooling.

For phase 1 lab exploration work, see [phase-1-exploration/](../phase-1-exploration/).

Full plan and details to follow as implementation progresses.
