# DESCRIPTION:
  # This script is intended to shutdown the entire k8s cluster as cleanly as possible.
  # It will cordon the worker nodes and shut down the entire k8s cluster.
  # The nodes will be uncordoned if started up with the startup-k8s-cluster companion script.
          #  This script saves the current running nodes it cordoned/shutdown in a text file (CORDON_LIST)
          #  The nodes are cordoned at shutdown to avoid the master starting pods on the first node that it sees on startup.
  #  There are log filesand work files located in /bss-scripts (see LOG_FILE)

#  PREREQUISITES
  # This script is intended to be run on an Ubuntu jump station that also runs startup-k8s-cluster.sh
  # kubectl config context on the jump station needs to be set to the correct cluster
  
  #  Run the following:
      #  On the Jump station:
          #  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "k8s-automation"
              # accept defaults on all prompts

          # ssh-copy-id your-username@<node-ip>

      #  On each worker/master node:
        #  sudo visudo
            #  add to bottom of file: bssadm ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown
