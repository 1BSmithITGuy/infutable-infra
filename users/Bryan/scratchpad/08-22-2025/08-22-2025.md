## Notes

questions before deployment:

Storage - for now just local storage?  

DNS - all my k8s and k3s clusters are already in there.

this is going on my kubeadm cluster, is that OK?

This will be shutdown a lot.  is that going to cause issues?  I guess I can leave it on?

how much Rsources do I need, I have 2 worker nodes, 2 vCPUs each (xeon w-2135 I think, pretty strong), 6 GB RAM each, 60 GiB disks each.  only thing running is ArgoCD and that can be decommissioned for now.  
    -  or, do I deploy with ArgoCD?  If so, should I create a project or do anything speciffic?
